On Thursday, Feb 6th, 
Vid Luther from Pressable visited with our Arches CodeUp Cohort
It was a pleasure to have him speak and share with us.

He shared a question and a point of view as his theme.
Why does a hosting company need programmers?

1. $problem_solving 	// programmers are problem solvers
2. $automation 			// since programmers are lazy 
						// Vid (and just about everybody else) wants to automate as much as possible.

3. $business_intelligence //programmers help immensely with data evaluation and analysis
